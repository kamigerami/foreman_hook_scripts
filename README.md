# Hook scripts
Some useful hooks I've created

- 00_validate_name.rb 

( A foreman hook script that enforces a naming standard for your hosts)


- 10_whitespace.sh

( A git pre-recieve hook that looks in the diff for trailing whitespaces and tabs )

- 15_puppet.sh

( A git pre-recieve hook that validates the puppet syntax and erb template files )
